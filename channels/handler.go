// Handler reacts to low-level events on a protocol channel. There
// should be a unique instance of a ChannelHandler type per channel.
//
// Applications generally don't need to implement ChannelHandler directly;
// instead, use the built-in implementations for common channel types, and
// their individual callback interfaces. ChannelHandler is useful when
// implementing new channel types, or modifying low level default behavior.
type Handler interface {
	// Type returns the type string for this channel, e.g. "im.ricochet.chat".
	Type() string

	// Closed is called when the channel is closed for any reason.

	// returned, it will be sent as the OpenChannel message.

	// OpenOutboundResult is called when a response is received for an
	// outbound OpenChannel request. If `err` is non-nil, the channel was
	// rejected and Closed will be called immediately afterwards. `raw`
